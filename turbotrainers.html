           <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_trainer">History of the turbo trainer</a></h1><br>
 

​
<p>
The first turbo trainer i remember was i think in the late 80s when they were first introduced.
 The one i had was just a horizontal square profiled bar with a 2 plastic cylinder shaped fans attatched on either end of 
 a small metal or plastic roller. On the other end of the metal bar was a place to attach you bicycle forks. The bottom bracket
  would rest on a small support pillar and the back wheel would rest on the roller. These early trainers did a great job even though
   they were noisy and not particularly smooth to pedal (often felt like pedalling through treacle) i did some of my best times for
    50 mile time trials in 1992 (1.45.41).
    With most of the earlier trainers you had to take out the front wheel of the bike and clamp the front forks to the trainer.
 As home trainers progressed a unit was devised where the front wheel of the bike did not need to be removed. These hinged
  units fitted to the rear wheel of the bike, all you need do is put something under the front wheel to lift it off the ground a couple of inches.
   In the early days most people used to use a telephone directory. It's these hinged units that are still used today. </p>

<h2>Types of turbo trainer</h2><br>

<h3>Wind (fan) resistance</h3> <br> <p>as mentioned above, is the earliest and cheapest models</p>

​

<h3>Fluid trainer</h3><br><p> one step on from the above. The fan is encased in a drum of oil, allowing a more fluid and quieter operation.
 The only downside is the drum can get extremely hot.</p>

​

 <h3>Magnetic trainer</h3> <br> <p> These were powerful magnets which enabled the resistance and the advantage is that some models came with a lever
  so you could vary the magnification (basically it was a cable that moved the magnet closer to the metal flywheel. The main disadvantage
   was they could never accumulate a lot of resistance and felt too easy.</p>

​​

<h3>Electromagnetic trainer</h3> <br><p>an improvement on the magnet as these were the first to use electric power and are basis behind all the modern
 trainers we have now. Advantages are a more realistic and structured workout. Disadvantages are they are expensive, require somewhere to
  plug them in and most of the training software you need to get the best from them are subscription based.
