               <h1><a href="https://bikerumor.com/2021/03/18/best-indoor-bike-trainer-accessories/">Gadgets</a></h1><br>
<p>
Stationary bikes can come with all sorts of accessories from simple handlebar mounted computers to complete
 android devices integrated into the bike.Some of the expensive models have power metres and electromagnetic resistance controls.
 <br>
<h2>Power Metres</h2><br>

<p>
I'm not going to go too much into power metres as I've never used one and the aim of this site is totally free workouts 
courtesy of Youtube so I'm catering for people who may be using more basic bikes. 
Unless you are in serious training and want to get the most out of workouts because you have races to prepare for then
 power metres are not necessary. They are very expensive and most people like myself who train just to keep fit will be
  fine with a heart rate monitor or fitness tracker.
Power metres come as pedals, cranks and hubs and can read the amount of effort put into each pedal stroke giving you a power
 reading and just like heart rate zones you can work to power zones.</p>
 
<h2>Heart rate monitors
(with chest strap)</h2><br>
<p>
Heart rate monitors have been around since "Polar" introduced their first product in the mid 80s and over the years have
 come on in leaps and bounds. There are so many brands to choose from at a relatively low price. Below are a few of the most popular.
</p><br>
​

<h3><li><a href="https://www.polar.com/uk-en/products">Polar</a></li></h3><br> <p>the oldest brand i can think of and still one of the best. 
    I used one back in the 1990s.</p>

​

<h3><li><a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/c/heart-rate-monitors/">Garmin</a></li></h3> <br> <p>Not used this model but is very poular and a leading brand.</p>

​

<h3><li><a href="https://uk.wahoofitness.com/devices/heart-rate-monitors">Wahoo</a></li></h3>  <p>this is the monitor i use now and works faultlessly.</p>

<h2>Heart rate zones</h2><br>
<p>
If you don't use a power metre then training to heart rate is the next best thing. When training to heart rate it's
 best to train to Zones. Before you do this you need to find your maximum heart rate.
The best most accurate way is to do a ramp test. Best done on a static bike but can be done on the road. The test is
basically an 8 to 10 minute ride that gets progressively harder and harder. By the end you should be riding totally flat out
 until you physically and mentally can't take any more. Because of the nature of this test it is advised to do it with someone
  present to give you encouragement as it's difficult to obtain the best results alone. If the ramp test is not for you then
   there are other less accurate ways to find max HR. </p>

​

​

​
<h2>Calculate max HR</h2><br>
<p>
The easiest but least accurate way is to subtract your age from 220. For example  someone aged 45 would have a maximum of 175 bpm.
 I recommend this method to anyone new to exercise as it will cut you a bit more slack.</p>

<h3 id="methods">Other methods:</h3><br>

<p>
    If you’re not in your 20s: 207 minus 70 percent of your age worked better in tests for people over 30, and of 10 and 16 year old boys.

    If you’re female, and over 35: try 206 minus 88 percent of your age.

    For older healthy adults, and for women, try this, 211 minus 64 percent of your age.
</p>
<h3 id="methods">Ramp test</h3><br>
<p>
For me, i found the last method most accurate. I haven't done a ramp test in years but have been an athlete most of my life so i know my limits.
 My age is 56 and the last method calculated 174 bpm. Not too far off. My max is around 183 to 185 based on some of the HIIT flat out 
 (near ramp test condition) sessions iv'e done. </p>
<h2>Zones</h2><br>




<table><caption>Workout Zones</caption>

<tr><th>Zones<th>% of Max Heart Rate<th>Zone Description<th>Zone Method</tr>
 <tr> <td>Zone 1 (Warm up)<td>50 - 60% of max HR<td>Active recovery<td>Relaxed easy pace with rhythmic breathing.</tr>
 <tr> <td>Zone 2 (Easy)<td> 60 - 70% of max HR<td>Aerobic capacity<td>A comfortable pace, where your breathing more deeply but can still hold a conversation.</tr>
 <tr> <td>Zone 3 (Aarobic)<td>70 - 80% of max HR<td>Tempo<td>Done at a moderate pace where it is difficult to hold a conversation as breathing is deeper and faster.</tr>
 <tr> <td>Sweetspot (Race pace)<td>Just between Zone 3 & 4<td>Race pace <td>It's hard but still just about enjoyable, only just!</tr>
 <tr> <td>Zone 4 (Threshold)<td>80 - 90% of max HR<td>Anaerobic threshold<td>Fast, almost uncomfortable pace.Breathing is forceful and cannot have a conversation.</tr>
 <tr> <td>Zone 5 (VO2 Max)<td>90 - 100% of max HR<td>VO2 Max<td>This is sprint pace and difficult to sustain for long.Breathing is laboured and erratic.</tr>

<h2>Fitness Trackers</h2><br>
<p>
Very popular with most people these days and a great incentive to get people out and be active. They tend to be more expensive than
 basic chest strap monitors but do have a much more varied usage from step tracker to phone and multi media. Although they are not
  quite as accurate in heart rate readings as a chest strap monitor they still give out a good enough reading to get a good workout.
   Here are a few of the most popular makes:</p>

​

<h3><li><a href="https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/trackers">Fitbit</a></li></h3> <p>one of the most popular brands available.</p>

​

<h3><li><a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxPfa-Yan8wIVWe3tCh0OVAAOEAAYAiAAEgLS_vD_BwE">Garmin</a></li></h3> <p>Very well respected make in the fitness community. I have one myself.</p>

​

<h3><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/watch/">Apple watch</a></li></h3> <p>As with all things Apple, you can expect the best quality at a premium price.</p>

<h2>Ant + speed & cadence</h2><br>
<p>
A great edition to any standard stationary bike that does not have it's own console is Ant+ speed and cadence sensor. 
For speed it's basically a magnet on the flywheel that is picked up by a sensor. For cadence it's a magnet on the cranks
 picked up by another sensor. These sensors send a signal via Ant+ which is installed on any android device. Some pc's may 
 need an Ant+ dongle. You then need to install an app that will read the signal from Ant+. There are loads of "cycle computer" apps
  all capable of giving you "speed, distance, pedal revs" ect.
   There are equally plenty of speed and cadence sensors on the market at reasonably cheap prices.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.coospo.com/">Coospo</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://uk.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-sensors">Wahoo</a></li>
</ul>


​
<p>
For them to fit a spin bike you need to find a speed and cadence sensor that is separated by a wire like the Coospo as most spin bikes 
have the flywheel at the front and does not overlap with the crank like a normal bike. But with a bit of adaptation it can be done.</p>

<h2>Cycle computers</h2><br>
<p>
If you can't use a speed and cadence sensor then most wired or wireless bike computer will be fine and can be easily adapted to fit any spin bike.
 Some bike computers also come with cadence sensor too but make sure cadence is separate to the speed sensor. You won't need Ant+ as you will have
  the handlebar cycle computer monitor to read from.</p>

<h2>What wheel size should I use?</h2><br>
<p>
Wheel size doesn't really matter as speed and distance is irrelevant in indoor cycling. What really matters is the effort and time you put in.
But it's nice to have figures to scrutinise after a ride. You should set your virtual wheel size (not flywheel) so that when doing a hard climb
 of about 50 revs per minute you should aim for about 10 mph (16kph). You will find that when doing 90 rpm you should be doing about 20 mph (32kph).
  I chose a measurement of around 1930 which seamed a good middle ground. (700 x 23c) 2096 is too high and you will be too slow on virtual climbs and flat roads.
   (22" x 1-3/8") 1770 is too low and you will ride virtual climbs too quickly and flat road riding will feel unnaturally too fast. But like I said it's
    not really relevant to a good workout. It's a personal choice. "Have fun" that's what really matters. </p>

<h2>Clipless pedals</h2><br>
​
​<p>

This is another personal choice of whether to use clipless pedals or not.
Spin bikes usually come with normal platform or bear trap pedals similar to what you would get on an MTB. If your happy using these that is fine. 
To get the best from your workout you could add toe clips and staps to your pedals to secure your feet more. But clipless pedals are best if you want
 to really give it that final sprint. The two main and well established companies are:</p>

​<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.lookcycle.com/za-en/products/pedals/road">Look</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/technologies/component/details/spd.html">Shimano</a></li>
</ul>


​

​
<h2>Cycling shoes</h2><br>
<p>
Of course if your going for clipless pedals then you will also need sturdy and stiff cycling shoes to clip on them. There are hundreds of brands out there.
 There is too many to mention so here is a link to "Cycling Weekly" shoe review and buyers guide.
Just remember
To wear the correct clothing. Padded cycling shorts or padded under shorts are vital to stop you getting too sore. Also using barrier creams like
 Sudocrem can stop you chaffing as unlike road cycling you don't move about on the saddle as much. Wear cool breathable lycra material and try aviod
  cotton t-shirts as they will soak too much sweat. And talking of sweat, always have a towel handy and plenty of water. At least one litre of water
   for an hours workout. Keep room ventilated and use a large fan if possible.
Also remember, if new to exercise it's best to first seek medical advice.</p>
