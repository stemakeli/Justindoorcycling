<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_cycling">A brief History (wikipedia) Indoor cycling:</a></h2><br>
<p>
 A way of riding a bike whilst not propelling yourself forward, so staying in a stationary position. 
Known as "exercise bike, stationary bike,spin bike" all these are indoor bikes but are different in all kinds of ways. But they are all used to cycle indoors.
Whilst turbo trainer (aka home trainers) are not exercise bikes in themselves, they do allow your everyday bicycle to convert into a static bike.
The first ever contraption vaguely resembling a spin/stationary bike was "The Gymnasticon " built in 1741 by  Nicolas Andry. Even though it was build
 mainly as a medical structure it paved the way for early physiopherapy.The Gymnasticon depended on a set of flywheels that connected the wooden treadles for the feet and to cranks for the hands.
In 1884 bicycle rollers were the first ever form of portable indoor cycling. They can be folded  away and stored even under a bed. According to Wikipedia ​Mile-a-minute Murphy is pictured riding on
 them as early as 1901.Bicycle rollers normally consist of three cylinders, drums, or "rollers" (two for the rear wheel and one for the front), on top of which the bicycle rides. A belt connects the
  middle roller to the front roller, causing the front wheel of the bicycle to spin when the bicycle is pedalled. The spacing of bicycle rollers can usually be adjusted to match the bicycle's wheelbase.
   Generally, the front roller is adjusted to be slightly ahead of the hub of the front wheel.Balancing the bicycle without riding off the rollers is an extra challenge for the rider and requires much more
    balance and attention than bicycle trainers. Some cyclists find that this increased attention to balance enhances their workout, while other cyclists simply prefer the more stable trainers.

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_(cycling)">(Acording to Wikipedia)</a></h3><br>
<p>
                    This is the man that started the spin bike revolution. He was from South Africa and was an endurance cycle racer. In the mid-1980s 
                    he was struck by a car while training for a race at night.Goldberg's early Spinning prototypes were targeted toward endurance athletes
                     as a substitute for outdoor bicycle training, and allowed the athlete to train year-round regardless of outdoor weather conditions.
                      In 1989 Goldberg opened the Johnny G Spinning Centre, in Santa Monica, California, with bikes he built. In 1992 he moved the class
                       to Karen Voight Fitness, in Hollywood, for more exposure.  In 1993 Goldberg and his business partner, cycling enthusiast John Baudhuin,
                        launched the Spinning indoor cycling fitness program in Santa Monica, California, through their business entity Mad Dogg Athletics, Inc. 
                        The first Spinning brand indoor cycling programs were held in Crunch gyms in New York, but were only regionally popular at that time.
                         By 1994, however, Spinning made national news on Rolling Stone Magazine’s “hot list as the ‘hot exercise’ you need to try. Goldberg and
                          Baudhuin made a deal with Schwinn, which debuted bikes at a trade show in 1995. The Spinning program expanded in the United States and worldwide.
                            By 1996 there were more than a thousand Official Spinning Facilities spanning over 30 countries. In 2003 Star Trac became the bike manufacturer.
                             Goldberg and Baudhuin trained thousands of instructors. “It was unique—the first time equipment, training, and philosophy was sold together,”
                              Goldberg said in 2004. Also that same year Goldberg retired from Mad Dogg Athletics and the Spinning brand. Mad Dogg Athletics has trained 
                              over 200,000 instructors in its Spinning program and has reached millions of fitness enthusiasts in over 80 countries worldwide through a network
                               of over 35,000 fitness facilities Popular brands of spin bikes.</p>

<h2>Types of stationary bikes</h2><br>

<h3>Upright bike</h3>
<p>
These bikes may be used as clothes horses more than exercise bikes but the user is sat in an upright position with the bars very close to the saddle.
 The resistance on these types of bike is minimal as the resistance is set at the cranks and tend not to have a flywheel. Popular for use with physiotherapy or
 someone who is normally sedentary but wants to start out on the road to be more physical. </p>
 
<h3>Recumbent bike</h3>
<p>
The recumbent, is a bike with a laid back position. The rider sits on a seat rather than a saddle. It's a bit like been sat in a car but instead of a clutch,brake 
and gas you have your pedal cranks. These types of bike are good for people with  back or hip problems.</p>

<h3>Racing/sports</h3>
<p>
Very popular style of exercise/spin bike.The position is much further forward compared to an upright.The forward lean mimics that of 
a racing bike utilising much more power from the hips.It also has the broadest price range from around £100 up to and above £2000.
 This style of bike i very popular amongst spin classes and gyms.  </p>
<h3>Electromagnetic</h3>
<p>
Electromagnetic exercise bikes usually have the flywheel at the back using powerful electrical powered magnets to make the resistance.
 In theory they are very good and you can get a good realistic workout but as with most things powered by electric and computer controls,
things can tend to go wrong or break down. </p>
<h3>spin bikes</h3>
<p>
Made popular in the 1980s by Johnny Golberg  aka Johnny G. It has a weighted flywheel at the front which is connected to the cranks either
 by a chain or belt. It is a "fixed wheel" meaning that you can not freewheel like on some of the electromagnet systems. It has a mechanism
  which rubs against the flywheel ( either felt or leather pad) to create friction which gives you your resistance. This is usually a knob 
  which can be turned to increase or decrease resistance. On some cheaper models it could be a brake caliper with a cable and a gear selector
like what you would find on a mountain bike.</p>
<h3>Belt driven</h3>
<p>
This is the most popular drive system as it requires virtually no maintenance and will serve you well for many years. The belts are made of
 robust rubber or Kevlar similar to a fan belt in a car. They don't require lubrication, won't rust or seize up.</p>
<h3> Chain driven</h3>
<p>
Just like bicycles, chain driven machines are  susceptible to wear and can slacken after use so regular light lubrication and maintenance is required. 
Cheaper models often have chains but some people prefer a chain drive as it gives them more of a real bike feel, even though they are noisier then a belt drive.
