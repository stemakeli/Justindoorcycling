           <h1><a href="https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/4678/buyers-guide-best-cycling-training-apps">Popular premium home trainer apps</a></h1><br>
            <p>
Not going to go too much into premium apps as this site is designed to offer totally free workouts via Youtube and other free sites.

Most of the popular trainers have their own apps. They usually offer a trail period but after that a subscription is required.</p>

<h2>Popular apps</h2> <p>Just to name few like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.zwift.com">Zwift</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bkool.com">Bkool</a></li>

<li><a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/696770">Tacx</a></li>
</ul>








<h2>Popular exercice bike apps</h2>
<p>
As with major turbo trainer manufacturers, exercise bike manufactures also have their own premium apps. Here is a small selection below:
All the apps for both exercise bikes and home trainers require a subscription and can be expensive. The machines themselves can be very expensive.

<h2>Free virtual apps</h2>
<p>
This is what my Blog site is aimed at. "Just indoor cycling " for free.

Unfortunately there are very few free apps out there, but below are the only few i can find.
</p>
​
<h3><li><a href="http://www.igrupetto.com/igrupetto.php?idi=en">Igrupetto</a></li></h3>


​<p>

I used to love using this site. It allowed you to ride a selection of pre-designed "Google street view" courses from around Europe, USA, Canada.
 You could use any spin bike fitted with (optional) Ant+ speed / cadence sensor. Or if no sensors you could input your speed manually. 
 It gave live speed, cadence, altitude and gradient info and the photo merging was seamless. But because of Google street view's new API 
 licencing regulation,in which websites have to pay to broadcast street view, this feature no longer works properly on "igrupetto" and you are
  presented with a "negative" picture format even though the program would still work but with less appeal. The other thing is this site is not
 secure, so don't input any personal information. Don't use any pass words you use on any other accounts especially bank accounts. Available on
    android and pc but need android  device for Ant+ speed cadence. You have to supply your own music.
</p>
<h3><li><a href="http://www.realindoor.com/">Real indoor cycling</a></li></h3>
<p>
Just  like "igrupetto" "real indoor cycling"  uses "Google street view" but does not have predefined routes. You have to select a start and finish
 place either by place name or map coordinates. For this app you don't need any extra equipment fitted to your bike as the route just rolls along at 
 a designated speed which you can adjust yourself. It even shows the gradient you are riding on but after 10 minutes or so it permanently sticks on a
  said gradient so the speed remains the same throughout but can be adjusted with the effort bar. It is possible to design a circular route but is complicated
   and time consuming. Another drawback is that it has a tendency to take you on roads or tracks that you don't want to go on. The merging of photos is quite good 
   and you can alter merge time frame. You can only save one self designed route.But again it is an insecure site so no personal information should be entered.
    Available on android and pc and you have to supply your own music.</p>

<h3><li><a href="https://www.bitgym.com/">Bitgym</a></li></h3>
<p>
Now bitgym isn't exactly free but iv'e listed it with the free apps as you can use the rolling videos for free for 10 minutes. That's 10 minutes for
 each video so in theory you could do a good hour plus workout but you would have to skip from video to video. You don't need extra equipment on your bike 
 as it uses your forward facing camera on your android device to detect your subtle head and body movements  to determine your revolutions per minute and is
  surprisingly accurate. It uses your revs per minute to determine the speed of the video. The video quality is superb, even better than some youtube videos.
   They are so smooth even over rough terrain and you get useful information about the area you are riding in, which can be disabled. They have coached programs
   # as well but these are premium only. The advantage with bitgym premium is you only need to buy one month at a time so no subscription is needed. Even though i
    do like bitgym at the end of the day it's still a video with the added extra of it slowing down or speeding up. Good for someone without a rev counter. 
    It has no music (unless you do the coaching sessions) but does have environmental sounds. In my opinion youtube videos are still a better choice. 
</p>
<h3><li><a href="https://www.cycle-go.com/">Cycle-go</a></li></h3>
<p>
This app is available on android, and is very similar in concept to zwift and the like. You don't need extra equipment on your bike as you are following cues
 as to what revs to do (follow pedal revs of the rider), level of perceived exertion,and what resistance you should use. It does have free workouts but these are
  limited.I don't think the premium feature is worth it though as your are still watching a video but with dated graphics. This site is not secure so be careful 
  with the info you input. </p>

<h3><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a></li></h3>
<p>
This is what my website/blog is all about. Totally free workout videos thanks to the great people out there going to a lot of effort to create some fantastic training
 videos for us all to use free of charge (as long as you don't mind the adverts). Below are some of the best cycling video sites to subscribe to.
</p>
<h3><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IndoorCyclingVideos">Indoor cycling videos</a></li>
    &
   <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/VirtualCyclingVideos">Virtual cycling videos</a></li></h3>
    <p>
These youtube sites have a great selection of cycling videos most in excellent HD quality. These videos tend to focus more on great scenic rides as opposed 
to HIIT (High intensity interval training). Great for doing a steady fat burn or cardio ride (or both). The good thing about these rides is you can make them as
 easy or as hard as you like. So these videos are ideal for someone just getting introduced to indoor cycling with a low level of fitness or are great for an easier
  ride the day after an HIIT session.</p>

<h3><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CTXCvideos">Paceline - CTX</a></li></h3>
<p>
I love these paceline videos. Reminds me of the days when i went out training with our local chaingang ( a group of riders, each taking a turn at the front).
 These videos range from moderate to high intensity intervals and are aimed at people with a more established fitness base and experience. With these workouts
  pacing yourself is the key.</p>

<h3><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Turbotrippingindoorcycling">Turbo tripping</a></li></h3>
<p>
Unlike CTX these videos don't use a paceline method but instead use long intervals at the front of a group or may be even alone. Designed for moderate intervals
 as apposed to high intensity ( though there may be a bit of HIIT so don't get too complacent). But don't be fooled as these videos are just as demanding.That's what 
 i like about these videos, they are psychologically demanding as the intervals don't have timers so you don't know when the effort is going to stop. So if your honest
  with your efforts and are really pushing hard, all you can think about is when will be it  time to ease off. Again pacing yourself is the key.
</p>
<h3><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Flatrater2010">Slipstreamer</a></li></h3>
<p>
Just like Turbo tripping, Slipstreamer concentrates more on the longer moderate intervals with plenty of climbing to boot. Most of the videos are located in
 Majorca and include some great climbs like Soller pass, Sa Colobra and Puig major. Together with great music these are a must for increasing  that resistance knob.
</p>
<h3><li id="global"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/gcn">Global cycling network  (GCN)</a></li></h3>
<p>
Global cycling network or GCN for short does not only concentrate on workout videos but cycling videos, hints tips and reviews of all the latest trends and is
 very entertaining. I found that their workout videos are some of the hardest and most demanding of all. Concentrating on studio or living room settings either
  on turbo trainers, spin bike or Watt bikes these videos can be as short as 20 minutes long but require purely flat out efforts so not for the faint hearted.
</p>
<h3><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/StudioSWEATonDemand">Spin class</a></li></h3>
<p>
So far these videos have been the least appealing to me, but you might like them. I find some of them a bit too "gym" orientated with arm exercises or dumb bell
 exercises whilst pedalling at the same time and i find some of the instructors a bit over the top. Please feel free to try them out.  

<h3><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6mCfZkaVItybijtWrECMcQ">Music</a></li></h3>
<p>
When it comes to indoor cycling, music is without doubt the most important element. It gets you motivated, sets the rhythm and creates the general mood of a
 particular workout. If you don't like the music on the video or just want different music, then mute the video and play your own music. There are a few indoor 
 cycling videos that don't have music. I have a few favourites:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/jQSmHvjo0Ec">BJCC Latar paceline</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/L1RJQi3jNh4">SDBC paceline</a></li>
    <li id="sticky"><a href="https://youtu.be/Q3AELRhB8YA">Road cycle traininig with sticky pt1 and pt2</a></li>
</ul>






​

<p class="last">Sometimes ​it's just nice to listen to the natural sounds of the video, the traffic,sounds of the tyres on the road, the gear changes, even the shouts and coughs
 from the cyclists. Reminds me of the time when i used to train in the bunches.
<span class="thoseads">Yes those ads on youtube really are annoying especially when in the middle of an interval, but</span>
<span class="hey">HEY! IT'S FREE!</span>
Just like outdoors, traffic lights / cars, can be a pain too. If you do want to disable the ads then you can pay a small fee of £11.99 per month 
for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium" style="color:#ff0000;">Youtube
 premium</a> (includes other benifits).</p>
