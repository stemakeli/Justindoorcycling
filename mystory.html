<h1>Serious Cycling</h1><br>

<p>I started cycle racing in 1981 at the age of 17. I was riding for the Yorkshire Clarion cycling club (now defunct). 
I discovered that i had quite a natural ability and within a couple of years i was winning races.</p><br>







<p>
I became quite well know in the north of England, settling club records:
10 miles 19 minutes and 54 seconds,
25 miles 52 minutes and 17 seconds and
50 miles 1 hour 45 minutes and 41 seconds<br>


Over the 30 years that iv'e been cycling i have rode for a few different cycling clubs:
Yorkshire Clarion C&AC (defunct) 1981-83
Airedale Olympic CC  (still going strong) 1884-1987 then 1994-present
Knaresborough Racing Team (defunct) 1988-1990
Morley CC 1991-1993 (also defunct)â€‹
In 1992 I won the Post office Nation 25 mile time trial in 52.17
Even though I had a natural ability I never really reached my potential in road racing as I didn't have the mental aggressive edge that a good
 road rider needs, even though I did manage to win a road race in 1983.
 I retired from cycling racing in 2000 after winning the CTC (Cyclists Touring Club, Now "Cycling UK") National 25 mile time trail in 53 minutes and 45 seconds.
</p>
<h2>Short running career</h2><br>
<p>
Even though I'd given up cycle racing, I was still cycling for fun on and off, but being an athlete, I had to find something to replace that buzz. 
That's when I started running and running races. Over the next 10 years my running was an on-off affair continually plagued with injury. 
Even though I managed a few good results, 50th place in Leeds half marathon (1.24.00) in 2003 and a 35 minute 10k the same year.
</p>
<h2>2011- The year that changed eveything.</h2><br>
<p>
That year  started well, I was cycling to work and back. I was working as a postman and keeping quite fit. I was also continuing to run but I'd given up 
running races a few years previous due to injuries. By June I decided to start training with a running club, I did a couple of runs with them and was
 intending to do more but all that was devastatingly taken away from me. In June I was cycling to work one morning when I was knocked off my bike by a hit
  and run driver who were never caught as they had false plates. My injuries were severe with smashed hip socket,fractured pelvis and broken finger.
  I'm glad I was wearing a helmet. I was in hospital for 2 weeks and had reconstruction surgery. I was on crutches for 6 weeks. By November I was cycling 
  again but only short distances as I was still feeling pain. I went back to work as a postman on light duties. By April 2012 I was delivering letters again
   and cycling occasionally but my pain was getting worse. The pain became so bad that I had to give up work and cycling. It turned out I had Vascular necroses,
    where the bone in my hip joint was dying due to no blood circulation as a result of damage from the accident. In September I had to have a total hip replacement 
    and bone graft in my left hip. I was advised by my surgeon to give up cycling as any fall could have catastrophic results and advised I should take up
     indoor cycling. Ever since then all I've ever done is "JUST INDOOR CYCLING".
</p>
<h2>My Family</h2>
<br>






<p>
I am married with 3 kids: Elizabeth, 12, George, 6 and Alasdair, 24 (from previous marriage). My wife Maka is from Georgia (a post soviet state).
 We try and get to Georgia every couple of years to see family. I even have a spin bike there. I work as a bus driver so with the long hours
  indoor cycling suits me better. I am 56 years old so have my last two children later in life, so anyone like myself struggling with work and family life is
   another plus for "just indoor cycling".</p>
