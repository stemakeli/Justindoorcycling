            <div class="txt">For our first video review we'll start with one of my favourites.
                 Around Port Phillip bay in Melbourne. Organised by "Raceatlas". 
                 It's one of the most popular events with thousands of cyclists taking part,
                  with the 210 kilometre
                 ride the most popular. The atmosphere at the start of the video is brilliant
                  and the music really motivates you. It starts in the early morning darkness
                   with a 10 minute warm up. Towards the end of the warm up the music builds up
                    in readiness to psych you up for the coming threshold  effort. You can decide
                     if you want to ride in zone 3 or 4 depending on how your feeling as these
                      intervals are 8 minutes long (X3) with 3 x 2 minute recoveries. Recovery
                       music is gentle and builds up again for each effort. Music during the
                        efforts is really motivating and encourages you to try hard. The last
                         effort section is a lone rider giving you the impression you are riding
                          in time trial mode, and it works brilliantly. I spend most of the last
                           8 minutes on the tri-bars. Then it's a nice steady cool down with nice
                            chill out music. Recommended cadence I'd say is 90-100 revs with maybe
                             80-90 revs for the last section.

            <div class="txt">A lovely sunny day here no matter what the weather at home.
                 A great scenic ride with a few small climbs. Nice steady start, allowing you
                  to warm up nicely before the first climb and increasing that resistance knob.
                   Good mixture of slower revs for the hills (70-80) and faster revs (100-110) for
                    the downhills. Saarland is a forested, southwestern German 
                    state bordered by France and Luxembourg. Named after the Saar
                     River, a tributary of the Moselle, Saarland is considered part
                      of the greater Moselle wine region. Its capital of Saarbrücken
                       is known for the Saarland Museum and the baroque-style Ludwig’s
                        church. In the nearby town of Völklingen, a restored 19th-century
                         ironworks now offers modern art exhibitions and concerts.

                Don't be fooled by this short workout. It is hard and requires full concentration. 
                Every second counts and the warm up is short, so your strait into it.
                 Working up from low to medium resistance with a couple of minutes.
                  Getting the revs up early. Don't burn out too quickly so pace yourself on
                   the intervals. The cool down at the end is also very short. If you have 
                   time then cool down for longer.
                    The GCN team produce fantastic videos whether it's indoor
                     cycling, outdoor cycling or reviewing the newest gadgets.</div>

             <div class="txt">Suitable for beginners or recovery.
                In your road to fitness it's good to start with something easy and pleasing to
                 the eye, so this lovely short sunny coastal ride is just the start you need. Starting 
                 from the hotel, the girls take us along the cycle path of
                  the lovely town of Cambrils. This is an easy or fat burning
                   ride with relaxing music. Ideally 90 revs per minute should be
                    just fine with a low to medium amount of resistance.
                Quick facts:
                Cambrils is a coastal town in the comarca of Baix Camp, province of Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain.
                 The town is near the tourist town Salou and is frequently visited by those travelling by air using Reus Airport.Wikipedia</div>
